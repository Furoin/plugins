[Pyrogram Smart Plugins](//docs.pyrogram.ml/resources/SmartPlugins) allow users to create and easily share modular framework's components with minimal boilerplate code. This repository is meant to collect awesome Pyrogram plugins.

## How to Use Plugins

- Create a new folder in your working directory (e.g.: *plugins*).
- [Download](https://github.com/pyrogram/plugins/archive/master.zip) and copy the desired plugin(s) into your *plugins* folder.
- Enable plugins in your Client by telling Pyrogram to search on your folder with `plugins_dir="plugins"`:
  ```python
  Client("my_account", plugins_dir="plugins")
  ```
- Done! Run your client with `Client.run()`, the plugins will be automatically loaded.
